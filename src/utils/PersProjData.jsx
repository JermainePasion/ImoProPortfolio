        Description1:"A quick dive in to my medieval-fantasy story, 'The Bard I Write For Is A Vampire!'. It talks about Shiloh, our not-so-undercover-runaway-noble who surprise surprise is a vampire. She believed leaving her vampire-noble family will lead to her finding her true identity: being a bard. Together with her is her knight, who has sworn to never leave her side (and also because her parents asked him to stay with her - for her sake), and unexpectedly - write her songs.",

Her career is a slow start not until she started singing the songs that her knight writes for her, it turns out she can't write to save her life! Join her as she tackles her newfound identity, while escaping her pasts and its enemies.",

        Description3: "Your silent knight - of unknown origin - is Shiloh's bodyguard that never left her side, even as she deserted her vampire noble family. Little does she know that her family tasked Aldo to stay by her side because you can never be too careful with her. So, while he fights to protect her from stray enemies here and there, he also writes her songs. Turns out he's got a knack for it. Let's watch both Shiloh and Aldo as they wander in new places, sing in unknown taverns, and possibly -  fall in love in the midst of lyrical chaos and creatures of the night,"
